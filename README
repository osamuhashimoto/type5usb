Arduino project to convert Sun Type 5 keyboard data to USB keyboard.

The Sun Keyboard uses a TTL level 1200 baud RS232 at 8N1 with inverted data.
This is read and keycodes are translated into a set of corresponding USB
keycodes.

USB output is done through the V-USB project, using a modified (and provided)
version of the vusb-for-arduino. Modified so that it sends Keypress and 
Keyrelease separately, and extending the range of available keys to incorporate
the larger number of keys on the Sun Keyboard.

Simple schematic is in the schema.txt file.

The Makefile approach requires a setup version of the Arduino-Makefile project,
found at https://github.com/mjoldfield/Arduino-Makefile.git
